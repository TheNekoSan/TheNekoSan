Hi, I’m @TheNekoSan,

As a graphic and motion designer, i'm interested in UI customization. 
For some reasons (3D apps,…) I often need to use Windows rather than Mac.

My big problem is that I really hate Explorer icons (nasty yellow folders…) and fonts (Tahoma, Verdana, Segoe UI,…) 
used by default in every Windows version since the 90's. Working (professionnaly) in this UI environment 
is a real pain for me and unfortunatly with no more standard real tools or settings available to theme it…

So, my current personnal "big" project is an alternative icon pack for Windows 11 using Dracula color set 
to fit with most available Dracula themes (Special mention to Niivu Themes here).
Working on it since One year it should be put here in some month. Hope you will find it useful ;-)
