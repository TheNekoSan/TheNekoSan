Hi, I’m @TheNekoSan,

For some reasons (3D apps,…) I often need to use Windows rather than MacOS.

I have discovered that I really hate Explorer icons (nasty yellow folders…) and fonts (Tahoma, Verdana, Segoe UI,…) used in every Windows version since the 90's. But hopefully we can use tools as 7tsp to hack icons with our own sets!

So, I'm working on an alternative full icon pack for Windows 11 using Dracula color palette to fit with most Dark themes and with most available "Dracula themes" (Special mention to Niivu Themes here). It's still in a work in progress state, and I should put here in some month. Hope you will find it useful ;-)
